# Random number generators in C
If you are serious about simulation, you should have your own trusted/controlled pseudo-random number generators (PRNG).
Here I implemented two PRNGs: Linear Congruential generator (LCG) and Permuted Congruential generator (PCG).
I have tested them against SP800-22 tests and the results are included.
